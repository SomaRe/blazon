            Anupama began as a freelancer to accommodate multiple personal
            requests of her friends to design and create exclusive props, custom
            invites, brochures and source out ethnic elements used especially
            for Indian wedding/cultural/dance events for artists in the US.
            Anupama has a deep understanding and appreciation of cultural
            aesthetics and visual arts due to her long-standing association with
            classical dance institutions like Kalakshetra, Chennai. The
            enthusiastic reception of her revolutionary designs and growth
            through word-of-mouth referrals led to the birth of Abikriti, in
            2014, named after her daughters. This nuanced creative perspective,
            combined with her successful experiences in managing a team of
            skilled graphic designers and installation experts at Blazon, makes
            Anupama uniquely positioned to bring your aesthetic vision to life.
            Abikriti specializes in concept, design, print, package, and deliver
